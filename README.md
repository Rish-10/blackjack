# blackjack
This project is a version of Blackjack I created from scratch, almost entirely on my own. 

I originally took the idea from viewing an online course and searching for the brief. Here is what I created from that: https://firstblackjack.netlify.app

From this, I invested my time into developing it to create something more interactive and more entertaining with an AI adversary. 

It doesn't have every single rule from a traditional game of BlackJack, but it has the most significant ones.

Please feel free to test it out, and let me know any feedback you have. 

Enjoy!
